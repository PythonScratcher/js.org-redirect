# Unix Time Converter  
The Unix Time Converter is a JavaScript framework that allows you to convert Unix timestamps to normal time.  

## Installation
You can install the Unix Time Converter framework by following these steps:  

Download the UnixTimeConverter.js file from this repository.  
Include the file in your JavaScript project.  

`<script src="path/to/UnixTimeConverter.js"></script>`  
Alternatively, you can use a module bundler like Webpack or Browserify to import the framework.  


`import UnixTimeConverter from 'path/to/UnixTimeConverter.js';`  
## Usage    
Once you have included the Unix Time Converter framework in your project, you can use it as follows:   


`const unixTimestamp = 1625745600; // Example Unix timestamp
const normalTime = UnixTimeConverter.convert(unixTimestamp);
console.log(normalTime); // Output: 7/8/2021, 12:00:00 AM (based on your local timezone)`  
In the code snippet above, we first import the UnixTimeConverter class from the framework. Then, we pass a Unix timestamp to the convert method, which returns the corresponding normal time. You can store the result in a variable and use it as needed.  

Please note that the convert method uses the local timezone of the user's browser to format the normal time. If you need to display the time in a specific timezone or format, you can modify the toLocaleString method in the UnixTimeConverter.js file.
